# Beam Installation Instructions:

## Creating a Google Cloud Account 
The majority of our demo will be done locally on the EC2 instances we set up, but a small part shows how you can run on the Google Cloud.  You can sign up for a year-long free trial, which gives you $300 in credit, but you do need to enter your credit card information.  If you don't want to do that, feel free to skip this step and just watch that part of the tutorial! 

### Here's how to sign up: 

- [Go to the Google Cloud homepage](https://cloud.google.com/)
- Select "TRY IT FREE" in the upper righthand corner 
- Agree to terms 
- Fill out information for your payments profile
    - Create an individual account 
    - Enter your name and address 
    - Enter your credit card (they swear they won't charge you!)
- Complete the profile 

### Disabling your account:
If you want to disable your account after the tutorial is over, follow the instructions [here](
